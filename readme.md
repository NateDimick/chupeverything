# The ChupEverything bot

**UPDATE** Feb 2023: ChupEverything had a good run, but Twitter has become a morally reprehensible platform - and while I have no problem spamming a site like Twitter with the garbage this bot produces and forcing them to store it in their databases, They have discontinued the free APIs. ChupEverything is not worth paying for, so it will end.

Two things to know:

1. Mayochup is an abomination
2. twitterbots such as 'FuckEveryName' are funny in a stupid way

The ChupEverything bot captures these two facts and tries to use them to it's adavantage.

I built this bot over the course of about three days. Does it produce kinda ~~shitty~~ images? yeah. But it gets 95% of the way there and I was happy enough to launch it as-is.

This project couldn't be done without:

* synesthesia.me
* dwyl/english-words
* tweepy, colormath, numpy, and PIL
* dafont user donshottype (is it dons hot type or don shot type?)
* COVID-19 and Stay at Home orders
* Heinz

This is a cron script now. Set `./runbot.sh` to execute in crontab. create and set up venv first.

# The ChupEverything bot

Two things to know:

1. Mayochup is an abomination
2. twitterbots such as 'FuckEveryName' are funny in a stupid way

The ChupEverything bot captures these two facts and tries to use them i=to it's adavantage.

I built this bot over the course of about three days. Does it produce kinda shitty images? yeah. But it gets 95% of the way there and I was happy enough to launch it as-is.
Future updates incoming when I feel like it. Ideas include:

* better color replacement
* collecting short trends for later use
* more skeletons
* mayocue and kranch added to the lineup

This project couldn't be done without:

* synesthesia.me
* dwyl/english-words
* tweepy, colormath, numpy, and PIL
* dafont user donshottype (is it dons hot type or don shot type?)
* COVID-19 and Stay at Home orders from our nation's caring and responsible governors, particularly Chris Sununu
* Heinz
